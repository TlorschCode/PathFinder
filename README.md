<h1 align="center">Path Finder</h1>
</hr>
<h3 align="center">Just a program I made to find the best possible path (within a hundredth of the actual answer or so) from one point to another for a school assignment. (Uses Bezier curve).</h3>
<p>The goal is to be able to create a path, then slightly tweak the control points and watch as the new version of the path is drawn over the other, colored darker or lighter depending on the speed of the path. The result should be a nice gradient with the fastest path highlighted with a lighter color than everything else.</p>
